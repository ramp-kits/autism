    "\n",
    "You can sign up to the challenge on the event page [ramp.studio](http://ramp.studio/) event. Here are the competition rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submissions will be trained on the 1150 subjects given in the starting kit and tested on a private set of size 1003. More information on the distribution of the public and private sets  can be found on the [challenge website](https://paris-saclay-cds.github.io/autism_challenge/).\n",
    "* The competition will end on July 1, 2018 at 18h UTC (20h in Paris).\n",
    "* All models will be trained on AWS instance `m5.xlarge` (4 CPUs and 16 GiB of RAM).\n",
    "* Participants will be given a total of 80 machine hours. Submissions of a given participant will be ordered by submission timestamp. We will make an attempt to train all submissions, but starting from (and including) the first submission that makes the participant's total training time exceed 80 hours, all submissions will be disqualified from the competition (but can enter into the collaborative phase). Testing time will not count towards the limit. Train time will be displayed on the leaderboard for all submissions, rounded to second, per cross validation fold. Since we have 8 CV folds, the maximum total training time in the leaderboard is 10h. If a submission raises an exception, its training time will not count towards the total.\n",
    "* There is a timeout of 15 minutes between submissions.\n",
    "* Submissions submitted after the end of the competition will not qualify for prizes.\n",
    "* The public leaderboard will display validation scores running a stratified CV with 8 folds and 20% validation set size, executed on the public (starting kit) data. The official scores will be calculated on the hidden test set and will be published after the closing of the competition. We will measure several scores of each submission: (i) the Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC) and (ii) the accuracy. The ROC-AUC will be used to rank submissions.\n",
    "* The organizers will do their best so that the provided backend runs flawlessly. We will communicate with participants in case of concerns and will try to resolve all issues, but we reserve the right to make unilateral decisions in specific cases, not covered by this set of minimal rules.\n",
    "* The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any participant found to violate the fair competitive spirit of the challenge. Possible reasons, without being exhaustive, are multiple accounts, attempts to access the test data, etc.\n",
    "* The challenge is essentially an individual contest, so there is no way to form official teams. Participants can form teams outside the platform before submitting any model individually, contact the organizers to let them know about the team, and submit on a single team member's account. However, submitting on one's own and participating in such a team at the same time is against the \"no multiple accounts\" rule, so, if discovered, may lead to disqualification.\n",
    "* Participants retain copyright on their submitted code and grant reuse under BSD 3-Clause License.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants accept these rules automatically when making a submission at the RAMP site."

You can check the starting-kit ([`feature_extractor.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/feature_extractor.py) and [`classifier.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/classifier.py)) for an example. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the similar way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/autism/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](http://www.ramp.studio/events/autism/leaderboard). \n",
